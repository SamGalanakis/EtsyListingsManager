# EtsyListingsManager


Uses etsy api to generate a csv in the required data feed file format for integration with facebook/instagram webshops. The facebook csv template can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/120325381656392?id=725943027795860). Only the required columns + the extra images are implemented although the code could easily be explanded to include more columns.

For use an etsi api key must be stored in a txt document "api_key.txt" in the root directory.

A useful guide for using the produced file is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzr559BMsjQ&t=668s).
